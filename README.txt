Rivet is a free open source decoder of various HF data modes which interest members 
of the Enigma 2000 group.

Currently the program decodes the modes XPA and XPA2 but more modes will be added soon.
At the moment the program only decodes pre-recorded .WAV files (mono and recorded at a
rate of 11.025 KHz or less) but I hope to add sound card decoding soon.

The program is written in Java so it should run on any PC which has Java installed.
If you haven't got Java then you can download it for free from ..

This program uses the excellent JTransforms library ..
